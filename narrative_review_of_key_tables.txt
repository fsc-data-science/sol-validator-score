NOTE: Everything in the first few slides is incorrectly framed.

It is the VOTER pubkey that validates.
SIMPLE: Stake_Pubkey "A" is owned by Authorized_Staker "Alice" who is also the withdrawer and custodian of "A".

Complicated: Stake Pubkey "B" is owned by Authorized Staker "Bob Inc", with the withdrawer as "Bob" and custodian of "Bob's future Holders Co".

Both "A" and "B" (as staker pubkeys) are delegating to Voter 2Y2.... (120 and 5000 respectively).
"A" activated in epoch 300 and has a planned deactivation in epoch 400
"B" has an activated at 320 and has no deactivation (i.e., max 1844,...,...15)

While judging Voter 2Y2 as a validator: 
 - # & Ratio of Simple to Complicated stakers

 - # & Ratio of Deactivation Planned vs not 
 - # & Ratio of expected lifecycle/churn of deactivations
   -- % of stakers that left in last x epochs; % of stakers that re-delegated to a different voter

 - Ratio of Staker Locks (most staked are not locked, some are though)
	
- total SOL delegated (sum account_sol from stakers) / avg / median sol delegated
 - GINI coefficient of delegators (mostly whales or many small fries) 
 - ratio of total account_sol / total activate_stake ??

Validators over time:
 - credit growth (variance, direction, etc. drops to 0)
 
Questions for Foundation
- Are we thinking of Validator right (VOTE_PUBKEY) or should we instead think of NODE_PUBKEY or other?
- Are planned deactivations relevant or are they artifacts? 

Tim: 
 - Rent Exempt vs Rent Epoch 
 - Credits Observed (drops to zero for certain stakers/voters - is this bad? why?) 
 - Does "Credits Observed" at the "Staker" level, actually make sense? 
	- 

----------------------------------------

- No, credits observed is not at the staker level. Staker level differences are errors.
- Although, different voters in the same Epoch can have different credits observed even at full participation.

- For a voter in the snapshot vote account table the active_stake at epoch X is ROUGHLY equal to the total active stake among all stakers to that voter minus the active stake of all stakers with a deactivation epoch equal to or less than X. This means for historical vote account, we can impute active stake at each epoch E[i] as the sum of activated minus deactivated stakes up to i. 
- EPOCH_INGESTED_AT within the historical vote account is the epoch of the data; while `EPOCH` is the last active epoch for that voter. This means inactive voters can bloat the data with inactive stake. Need to check for active and reactivates.
  IF epoch_ingested = epoch THEN voter was active in epoch_ingested
   ELSE IF (epoch_ingested - epoch) = 1 deactivates in epoch_ingested (or data missing but in aggregate should be roughly accurate)
   ELSE (epoch_ingested - epoch) > 1 currently_deactive
 IF back to back deactivated (voter might have deactivated, then reactivated in the same epoch between ingest timestamps?)

@ Tarik to update snapshot_vote_accounts to match RPC of historic_vote_accounts
  - could keep it as snapshot_vote_status 2nd RPC has special notes: epoch_status (deliquent vs current), active_stake, COMMISSION, EPOCH_VOTE_ACOUNT (FALSE/TRUE), LAST_VOTE (similar to root slot but root slot precedes it slightly) 


Self-Stake
 Vote Pubkey has a single node_pubkey (1:1) 
  If node_pubkey is an authorized staker or withdrawer for a stake_pubkey that matches the vote_pubkey 
 2Y2 Vote has self staked via stake pubkey 5nZZN
